## About Me

<div class="message">
  <p>
    Not to confuse me with the actor Chris O'Donnell. I'm from central Pennsylvania, attended college in Pittsburgh and now live in New York City. A hobby of dabbling in game development turned in to a web development carrier.

  <p>
    I'm a big enthusiast for Ruby on Rails, but also do not mind getting my hands
  dirty in Javascript, I have recently started to dive into React. Usually
  working in Linux, I have found that tmux goes incredibly well with vim and my
  general TDD workflow. For a technical look check out my
