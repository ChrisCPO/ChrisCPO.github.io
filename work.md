## Things I do for money

I have worked on numerous Rails projects not limited to:

- [vinous](https://vinous.com/)

- [delectable](https://delectable.com/)

You can always grab my full [Resume][1]

## Things I do for fun

- I have recently become a collaborator on [rspec\_api\_blueprint](https://github.com/calderalabs/rspec_api_blueprint)
which has been neglected for sometime I'm going to bring it up too speed.

- I have a long term project that I have been working on that is a web driven
  tabletop game. I'm in the process of switching over the front end to React
from Rails. Details and Info will be released over time.
